Without any styles. Just raw html

## Getting Started

Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn``` (if exists) after cloning

Then just ```npm run dev``` or ```yarn dev```

### pls, note:
using my own react boilerplate instead of create-react-app, so there could be some not relevant things for this task =|
